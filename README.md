# Safe Boda On Boarding System
This is the repository for team bajaj collaboration during the cohort-2 CodeQueen Hackathon.
We are building a solution to solve the challenges experienced by SafeBoda staff during the registration of new riders.

### The Solution
A web application that Safe Boda staff can use to collect rider data and store it in a cebtral database that both field and academy staff can access. System users will be able to view rider profiles, edit information, and activate the rider if all requirements have been fulfilled.

This web application will feature a dashboard that displays an overview of the data collected in a visual way that is easy to understand. Syetem users will be able to view and download daily & weekly reports about the various stages of the on-boarding process, such as the number of riders registered, in training and ready for activation.

### Problem Areas Addressed
1) Coordination of data collection between different teams
2) Digitalisation of the slow manual recuritment process
3) Lack of proper authentication system
4) Tracking the progress of the rider onboarding process

### Team Bajaj Contributers
